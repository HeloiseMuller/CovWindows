# CovWindows
CovWindow used the ouput generated by bedtools genomecov -d to calculate the average sequencing depth by windows

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/HeloiseMuller/CovWindows
cd CovWindows
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

## Run CovWindow

### Usage
`-w` is the window file with a bed file format. It has 3 mandatorry colomns: chromosome (or scaffold), begin position and end position. 
A 4th colomn can be added with the name of the windows. In this case the option -f is necessary
`-c` is the coverage file. It is the ouput generated by bedtools genomecov with the option -d that reports the depth at each genome position with 1-based coordinates.

### Outputs
By default, CovWindows gives the average sequencing depth over all the windows if the window file.
One can get the average sequencing depth for each window with the option `-d`. In this case, one can use the option `-o` to save the depths in a file
